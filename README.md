- **blood_alcohol_app**  
This program allows you to calculate your *blood alcohol content* (BAC) based on a famous formula developed in the 1920s by the Swede **Erik Widmark**, professor of Medical Chemistry at the University of Lund. According to the formula, a person's BAC is roughly equal to the quantity of alcohol consumed (in grams) divided by the product of the person's weight and a gender-related constant (\&#x2192; for further details just have a look into the app's Python file). Although research has made progress since Widmark's times, alternative calculation models have been brought up, and Widmark's approach has not remained free of criticism, his formula has held its ground so far for purposes of a rough orientation and appears still to be relevant e.g. to forensic alcohol analysis. - The program demonstrates how to build a simple GUI with Tkinter, how to switch between different frames and how to process (i.e. validate / evaluate) user input.  
- **bmi_app**  
This program, the modest output of a standard programming exercise, provides a very basic GUI app designed to calculate the *"body mass index"* (BMI) as it is commonly defined (= the body weight divided by the square of the body height). The program demonstrates how to build a simple GUI with Tkinter and how to process (i.e. validate / evaluate) user input.  
- **caesar_cipher**  
Implementation of a famous ancient encryption algorithm: the substitution cipher named after the Roman statesman C. Iulius Caesar. It demonstrates the use of functions with parameters and of the list index method, as well as the embedding of an ASCII art logo. (Inspired by the project of "Day 8" of Angela Yu's course *"100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021"*, as offered on the learning platform Udemy.)
- **guess_the_number**  
A very simple "number guessing game", probably known to most beginning programmers as it appears in many courses and tutorials (regarding many programming languages). It is an exercise in the use of variables, the use of conditionals/branches, and the use of functions - and includes, as a small bonus, also the embedding of ASCII art fonts.
- **hangman**  
A rather unpretentious implementation of one of the most popular (word) guessing games played via the command line (- dating back probably to the 19th century, the game itself has been a classic for a long time among language learners all over the world). You will find a simple version here that allows only to play against the computer (*hangman_simple.py*), and a more advanced version that includes both a singleplayer and a multiplayer modus (*hangman.py*). For the purpose of the singleplayer modus (be it in the simple or the advanced version of the game), the file *hangman_words.py* provides as an example wordlists in three languages (English, Italian, German) to be used by the computer to select a word to guess. (For further information concerning the logic of the game and its translation into code, just have a look into the files mentioned before.) - The program demonstrates how to use variables and conditionals/branches, how to import files and how to process (i.e. validate / evaluate) user input. (Inspired by the project of "Day 7" of Angela Yu's course *"100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021"*, as offered on the learning platform Udemy.)
- **snake_game**  
A modest variant of the classic video game "Snake", told to have been developed in the late 1970s and familiar not least among the users of the former generations of some mobile phones. The implementation presented here - the result of a programming exercise (cf. "Day 20"/"Day 21" of Angela Yu's course *"100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021"*, offered on the learning platform Udemy) - has been done using Python's **"Turtle" module**. It may just be considered a first exercise in the use of classes (including the inheritance of classes) and of Object-Oriented Programming, but may also turn out to be a useful introduction to basic requirements of a computer game equipped with a graphical user interface (--> designing the screen, creating the required objects, defining key events and their desired handling, implementing a game loop, keeping track of the score ...).
