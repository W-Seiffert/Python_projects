- **snake_game**  
A modest variant of the classic video game "Snake", told to have been developed in the late 1970s and familiar not least among the users of the former generations of some mobile phones. The implementation presented here - the result of a programming exercise (cf. "Day 21" of Angela Yu's course *"100 Days of Code - The Complete Python Pro Bootcamp for 2021"*, offered on the learning platform Udemy) - has been done using Python's **"Turtle" module**. It may just be considered a first exercise in the use of classes (including the inheritance of classes) and of Object-Oriented Programming, but may also turn out to be a useful introduction to basic requirements of a computer game equipped with a graphical user interface (--> designing the screen, creating the required objects, defining key events and their desired handling, implementing a game loop, keeping track of the score ...).
